## Training and Testing

Please use [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR), it is an open-source image super-resolution toolbox based on PyTorch.
If you encounter any issues during use, please refer to [MambaIRv2](https://github.com/csguoh/MambaIR) — it is an excellent work and may provide helpful guidance.

ABSTRACT = {The inability of existing super-resolution methods to jointly model short-range and long-range spatial dependencies in remote sensing imagery limits reconstruction efficacy. To address this, we propose LSTMConvSR, a novel framework inspired by top-down neural attention mechanisms. Our approach pioneers an LSTM-first–CNN-next architecture. First, an LSTM-based global modeling stage efficiently captures long-range dependencies via downsampling and spatial attention, achieving 80.3% lower FLOPs and 11× faster speed. Second, a CNN-based local refinement stage, guided by the LSTM’s attention maps, enhances details in critical regions. Third, a top-down fusion stage dynamically integrates global context and local features to generate the output. Extensive experiments on Potsdam, UAVid, and RSSCN7 benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 33.94 dB PSNR on Potsdam with 2.4× faster inference than MambaIRv2.},
